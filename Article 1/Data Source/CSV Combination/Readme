# 🧠 Folder Translation and CSV Generation Pipeline

## **Overview**
This script automates the **translation and conversion** of multilingual Wikipedia-style datasets into **standardized English CSV files**.  
Each subfolder in the source directory represents a topic (e.g., *“中国篮球史” → “History of Chinese Basketball”*), containing multiple `.txt` files of textual content.  

The script uses **OpenAI’s GPT models** to translate folder names into English, detects duplicates automatically, dynamically adjusts batch sizes for translation requests, and merges all text files under each folder into one structured CSV file.
