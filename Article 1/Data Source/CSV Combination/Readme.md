# Folder Translation and CSV Generation Pipeline

## Overview
This script automates the translation and conversion of multilingual Wikipedia-style datasets into standardized English CSV files. Each subfolder in the source directory represents a topic (e.g., “中国篮球史” → “History of Chinese Basketball”), containing multiple .txt files of textual content. The script uses OpenAI’s GPT models to translate folder names into English, detects duplicates automatically, dynamically adjusts batch sizes for translation requests, and merges all text files under each folder into one structured CSV file.

## Key Features
- Automated translation of folder names (multi-language → English)
- Dynamic batching for efficient OpenAI API usage
- Automatic duplicate detection and skipping
- Consolidation of multiple .txt files into a single CSV per topic
- Continuous live logging and heartbeat monitoring for progress tracking

## Input Data

### Directory Structure
The script expects the following format under the base directory:

    /local/scratch/group/guldigroup/climate_change/wiki_history_nan/History of sports/
    │
    ├── 中国篮球史/
    │   ├── 001_intro.txt
    │   ├── 002_development.txt
    │   └── 003_teams.txt
    │
    ├── 日本柔道史/
    │   ├── 001_origin.txt
    │   ├── 002_training.txt
    │   └── 003_championships.txt
    │
    └── Футбольная история/
        ├── 001_early.txt
        ├── 002_worldcup.txt
        └── 003_rules.txt

Each folder:
- Represents one topic (often non-English)
- Contains .txt files with UTF-8 text content

## Configuration Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **BASE_DIR** | Source directory containing multilingual folders |
| **OUTPUT_DIR** | Destination directory for English-translated CSVs |
| **API_MODEL** | OpenAI model used (gpt-4o-mini) |
| **BATCH_SIZES** | Adaptive batch sizes: [200, 100, 50, 20, 5, 1] |
| **SKIP_COUNT** | Index to resume from (useful for restarting large runs) |

## Processing Workflow

### Scanning and Grouping
All .txt files under BASE_DIR are recursively scanned and grouped by their parent folder name. Each group represents one concept/topic.

### Translation Phase

#### Step 1 — Single Translation Mode
Each folder name is translated individually via OpenAI’s ChatCompletion API.

Prompt:  
Translate to English; return ONLY the translation.

- Retries automatically on rate limit errors (HTTP 429) with 20-second delays.  
- If the translated English name already exists in the output directory, it is logged as DUPLICATE and skipped.  
- The first new translation triggers the switch to batch mode.

#### Step 2 — Dynamic Batch Translation
Translations proceed in adaptive batches for efficiency.
- Batch sizes follow this hierarchy: 200 → 100 → 50 → 20 → 5 → 1  
- On JSON parsing or API errors, the batch size is reduced and retried.  
- Each batch request expects a strict JSON array of English strings.

## CSV Assembly
After translation, all .txt files within each folder are concatenated into a single CSV file with the following structure:

| filename | content |
|-----------|----------|
| 001_intro.txt | full text content... |
| 002_development.txt | full text content... |
| 003_teams.txt | full text content... |

CSVs are saved under OUTPUT_DIR, named after the English translation (e.g., History of Chinese Basketball.csv).

Example output:

    /home/njian29/Desktop/history of sport/
    │
    ├── History of Chinese Basketball.csv
    ├── History of Judo in Japan.csv
    └── History of Football.csv

## Logging and Monitoring
A background thread continuously prints real-time progress:

    [14:33:05] translate_batch: 50 items

Console logs include:
- NEW → new English translation and CSV written  
- DUPLICATE → already processed topic  
- 429 or JSON error → retry or reduce batch size  
- All remaining folders done → successful completion  

## Output Summary
| Output Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **CSV files** | One per topic, containing all text files combined |
| **File naming** | English translation of the folder name |
| **Encoding** | UTF-8 |
| **Logs** | Real-time print output (status messages + progress) |

## System Behavior
| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| translate_single() | Translates a single folder name using GPT |
| translate_batch() | Translates multiple folder names in one request (adaptive) |
| write_csv() | Combines all .txt files into a CSV file |
| csv_path_from_eng() | Builds safe, ASCII-only output paths |
| status_printer() | Heartbeat thread printing live progress |
| main() | Orchestrates scanning → translating → writing |

## Final Result
After completion, the output directory (/home/njian29/Desktop/history of sport/) will contain:
- Clean, English-labeled CSV files, one for each multilingual topic  
- Each CSV is ready for downstream use in:
  - Topic modeling and clustering  
  - Language reuse analysis  
  - Cross-language comparison  
  - Visualization or digital humanities pipelines  

## Example Log Snippet

    Distinct folders: 31,450; starting at #31,307
    → 开始 translate_single('中国篮球史')
    ← 完成 translate_single('中国篮球史') → 'History of Chinese Basketball'
    [31307/31450] 中国篮球史 → History of Chinese Basketball NEW

    ──── Switching to dynamic batch mode ────
    Trying batch size 200: items 31308–31507
    ← 完成 translate_batch
    日本柔道史 → History of Judo in Japan written
    Футбольная история → History of Football DUPLICATE
    All remaining folders are done.

## Notes
- The script does not currently persist progress. Restarting will reprocess from the beginning unless SKIP_COUNT is adjusted.  
- flush=True ensures console outputs appear immediately (important on HPC systems).  
- If running in VS Code or Jupyter, include:

        if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
            sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=True)

  to prevent compatibility errors.
